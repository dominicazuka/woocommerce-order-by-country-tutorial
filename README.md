Woocommerce Order by Country
Welcome to the Woocommerce Order by Country GitHub repository! This repository contains the code for adding a country filter to your WooCommerce order management screen. With this feature, you can easily filter and organize orders based on the billing country.

Tutorial
To see the step-by-step tutorial on how to implement this feature, please refer to the hosted live server tutorial. The tutorial will guide you through the process of adding the country filter dropdown to your WooCommerce order management screen.

Prerequisites
Before getting started, ensure the following:

You have a live server where your WordPress website is hosted.
Your WordPress theme has a child theme. If you don't have a child theme, we highly recommend creating one to ensure your customizations remain intact during theme updates.
You have access to the functions.php file of your child theme. This is where you'll add the code for the country filter feature.
Installation
To add the country filter to your WooCommerce order management screen, follow these steps:

Locate the functions.php file of your child theme. It can be found in the following path: public_html/wp-content/themes/[your theme name]/[your theme child theme]/functions.php.
Open the functions.php file in a text editor.
Copy the code from the add_country_meta_data function to the end of the file.
Paste the code into the functions.php file, right after any existing code.
Save the file.
Refresh your WordPress website.
That's it! The country filter dropdown should now be visible on your WooCommerce order management screen. You can use it to filter orders based on the selected country.
